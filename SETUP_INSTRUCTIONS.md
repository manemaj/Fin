## 🔧 Setup Steps (One-Time Setup)

### Step 1: Create the Database Table

Your Supabase project is already configured, but you need to create the database table:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com
   - Log in and select your project: `hkjwhbezlujqlwqmkrlh`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"New Query"**

3. **Run This SQL Code**
   
   Copy and paste this entire code and click **"Run"**:

```sql
-- Create user_profiles table
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    full_name TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    modules_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    quizzes_passed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    time_spent INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    completed_modules INTEGER[] DEFAULT '{}',
    streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_active_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id)
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for user_profiles
-- Users can read their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
    ON user_profiles
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can insert their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
    ON user_profiles
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
    ON user_profiles
    FOR UPDATE
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_user_id ON user_profiles(user_id);

-- Create function to update updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create trigger to automatically update updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER update_user_profiles_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON user_profiles
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

4. **Verify Table Creation**
   - Go to **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - You should see `user_profiles` table listed

### Step 2: Enable Email Authentication

1. Go to **"Authentication"** → **"Providers"** in Supabase
2. Make sure **"Email"** is **enabled**
3. For testing, you can **disable** "Confirm email" (enable it later for production)
4. Click **"Save"**

2. Click **"Sign Up"** button in the navigation
3. Create a test account:
   - Full Name: Your Name
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: password123 (minimum 6 characters)
4. Click **"Create Account"**
5. You should see a success message! 🎉

### What Happens After Sign Up:

1. ✅ Your account is created in Supabase
2. ✅ You're automatically logged in

## 🎮 How It Works

### **Sign Up Flow:**
```
User clicks "Sign Up" 
→ Fills in name, email, password
→ Account created in Supabase Auth
→ User profile created in database
→ Automatically logged in
→ Progress tracking begins!
```

### **Login Flow:**
```
User clicks "Log In"
→ Enters email and password
→ Supabase verifies credentials
→ Session created
→ Progress loaded from database
→ User can continue learning
```

### **Progress Saving:**
```
User completes a module or quiz
→ Progress updated in memory
→ Automatically saved to database
→ Syncs across all devices!
```

## 📊 What Gets Saved

When users complete modules, the system automatically tracks:

- ✅ **Modules Completed** - Total number of modules finished
- ✅ **Quizzes Passed** - Number of quizzes completed successfully
- ✅ **Time Spent** - Minutes spent learning
- ✅ **Completed Modules Array** - Which specific modules are done
- ✅ **Streak** - Consecutive days of learning
- ✅ **Last Active Date** - When they last used the app

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication service not available"
**Solution:** Refresh the page. The Supabase client needs to load.

### "Error creating user profile"
**Solution:** Make sure you ran the SQL code in Step 1 to create the database table.

### User can't sign up
**Solution:** 
1. Check if email provider is enabled in Supabase
2. Open browser console (F12) to see detailed error
3. Make sure password is at least 6 characters

### Progress not saving
**Solution:**
1. Check if `user_profiles` table exists in Supabase
2. Verify RLS policies are set up correctly
3. Check browser console for errors

### Can't see success/error messages
**Solution:** Check if there are any console errors. The notification system should work automatically.

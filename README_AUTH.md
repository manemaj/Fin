## 🎯 What I Fixed

Your code already had most of the authentication system implemented, but was missing one critical function:

### Added: `updateProgressDisplay()`
This function updates the UI when progress is loaded from the database. Without it, users would see 0% progress even after loading their saved data.

```javascript
function updateProgressDisplay() {
    // Updates circular progress bar
    // Updates stats (modules, quizzes, time)
    // Shows user's actual progress
}
```

**Location:** `script.js` line 4821
